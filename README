Random Student Selector

This is a little Java Swing application I wrote to help me select a random
student in class to answer my next question. It uses Hibernate with MySQL for
the data backend.

I put it together in a couple of hours, which means the core functionality is 
there, but iit really still has lots of rough edges, like:

* I've hard coded the directory that the student photos are located in, which 
    was neither a good practice, nor now that I think of it a good place to
    store the pictures in the first place.
* I made a one to many relationship between course and student, which in 
    the long run is most definitely going to bite me.
* I coded the beginnings of being able to switch between different courses, but
    other than showing a dropdown it doesn't actually do anything yet.
